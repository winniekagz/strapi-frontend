# Examples

Reference code for Server Components, auth, and client components. Use or copy into the app as needed.

## Contents

- **Server Components** – blog list and single blog fetch/render
- **Auth** – server-side session helpers, protected page, middleware, login API route
- **Client components** – BackButton, Pagination, LoginPage, CodeBlock

All examples use TypeScript and Next.js App Router; auth examples target Strapi but patterns work with any backend.
